Resonances and fit fractions from [arxiv:1507.03414](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.03414.pdf)

`creat_params.py` is a script to create random parameters which has the same fit fractions in `ft_frac.txt`. Since the phase and factor of partial wave in each resonance is random number, the total shape is different.
